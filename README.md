PROJECT: OpenFetch v1

WHO IS IT FOR?
Developers who want to fetch public APIs easily

CORE PROBLEM (1 sentence):
Users cannot quickly discover, test, and save APIs

V1 GOAL (binary):
A user can:
1. Sign up
2. Browse APIs
3. Copy API endpoint
4. Save API to favorites

OUT OF SCOPE (important):
- No themes
- No dark mode
- No analytics
- No social features
- No perfect UI

DONE = deployed + usable + ugly



### STEP 6: How future projects should be planned (memorize this)

Every project must answer these before code:

What is the smallest usable version?

What features are forbidden?

What components exist?

What pages exist?

What does “done” mean?

If you skip this → you WILL stall again.
